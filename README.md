Application Reviewed

A simple Python login application was selected for security review.

Source Code

```python
username = input("Enter username: ")
password = input("Enter password: ")

if username == "admin" and password == "12345":
    print("Login Successful")
else:
    print("Login Failed")
```

Vulnerabilities Identified

1. Hardcoded Credentials

Risk Level: High

2. Weak Password Policy

Risk Level: High

3. Plain Text Password Handling

Risk Level: High

4. Missing Input Validation

Risk Level: Medium

5. No Account Lockout Mechanism

Risk Level: Medium

6. No Logging System

Risk Level: Low

7. No Multi-Factor Authentication

Risk Level: Medium

Security Recommendations

Use password hashing (bcrypt)
Store credentials securely in databases
Enforce strong password policies
Implement account lockout
Add input validation and sanitization
Enable authentication logging
Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
